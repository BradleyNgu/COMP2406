1. If I removed line 24-33, I get a Sqlite Error. Since db.execute() creates a the people table, by removing it, 
the application cannot insert data into it leading to an error. I tested it by running 
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write dbdemo2.js then running a curl command to add to the database. 
After that I run into the error below:
SqliteError: no such table: people

}

2. Yes there is a pattern. The pattern is that all page title are 
prefixed with the value of appTitle, which is "COMP 2406 DB Demo 2." 
The pattern is centrally determined by the template_header function, 
which appends the specific page title to appTitle. In this case I changed 
const appTitle = "Bruh"; and observed that the Browser tab now says bruh when 
/list or /analyze is typed at the end or the local host url.


3. When I run the code, /add.html sends me to a form submission page where I can submit information. 
After pressing the submit button it sends data to the /add route and the new record is added to the database. 
After this I checked /list and saw that my submission was saved to the database.

4. If I run dbdemo2 with line 338 I am able to properly close the database and close the program when I input ctrl + c in terminal.
200 GET text/html /list
200 GET text/css /style.css
SIGINT received, terminating...
Server terminating, closing database.

If I run dbdemo2 without line 338, the database never closes and ctrl + c does not work, thus I have to forcefully terminate the program.
200 GET text/html /list
200 GET text/css /style.css
SIGINT received, terminating...
I have to kill it here in order to end

For both of these scenarios, I tested http://localhost:8000/list and pressed ctrl + c to see what happens.

5. There is a maximum number of records that will be shown by /list. In the getAllRecordsDB function where it says the limit is 50. To test this, I wrote this function:
function addSampleRecords(db, table) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
        addRecordDB(db, table, {
            name: `Person${i}`,
            city: `City${i}`,
            country: `Country${i}`,
            birthday: `1990-01-${String(i).padStart(2, '0')}`,
            email: `person${i}@example.com`
        });
    }
    console.log("50 records added to the database.");
}
addSampleRecords(db, table);

This function adds 50 records into the database. In this case since there are already 2 records in the database, I added another 50 and it proves that the max is 50 when listed as in /list, I counted 50 records.

6a. I can modify the client-side code to sort the city list using sort() on the array of cities by adding this:
var cityListArray = analysis.cityList.map(row => row[0]); <- this line extract the first element from each row of the analysis.cityList array which creates a bew array that contains only city names
cityListArray.sort(); <- This sorts the array
var cityList = '<li>' + cityListArray.join('</li> <li>') + '</li>';

When first approaching this problem, I thought I could just use .sort() and be done but I realized its more much efficient if I extracted and mapped the city names then use sort.

6b. function analyzeRecordsDB(db, table) {
      var analysis = {};

      // Get the count of all records in the table
      const countQuery = db.query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM " + table);
      analysis.count = countQuery[0][0];  // Extract the count from the query result

      // Fetch distinct cities sorted alphabetically
      const cityQuery = db.query("SELECT DISTINCT city FROM " + table + " ORDER BY city ASC");
      analysis.cityList = cityQuery.map(row => row[0]);  // Extract just the city names

    return analysis;
  }
SELECT COUNT(*) query returns the total number of records in the table in which its stored in analysis.count
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM table ORDER BY city ASC fetches the unique city names and sorts them in ascending aplabetical order.
cityQuery.map(row => row[0]) extracts the city name from easch row and returns an array of arrays.

This is the same thinking as 6a but using SQL commands.

7a. To add a list of unique conuntries to the page, we can do
analysis.countryList = db.query("SELECT DISTINCT country FROM " + table + " ORDER BY country ASC").map(row => row[0]);

In the showAnalysis function I then need to render the list by converting the countryList array into an HYML ordered list with <li? elements

var countryList = '<li>' + analysis.countryList.join('</li><li>') + '</li>';

This takes the sorted list of countries and turns it into an order HTML list:

<p>Countries:
  <ol>
    ${countryList}
  </ol>
</p>

7b.

To get the count I need to retrieve the counts for both unique cities and unique countries.

analysis.uniqueCityCount = db.query("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) FROM " + table)[0][0];
analysis.uniqueCountryCount = db.query("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) FROM " + table)[0][0];

To then display these counts, I included them in the HTML body like this:

<p># Unique Cities: ${analysis.uniqueCityCount}</p>
<p># Unique Countries: ${analysis.uniqueCountryCount}</p>

For both 7a and 7b, I just used the SQL query to retrieve information, then displayed it within the HTML body.

8. In the add.html I wrote <input id="birthday" type="date" name="birthday" required>. on line 25. 
In this case, I didn't need to modify the dbdemo2.js code as there is a date selection that 
is strict so you wont get a month 13 or day 32. It will always make the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
To get to this, I searched on YouTube how to work with dates in html and got the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCklKwo2TmQ&ab_channel=CWM-CodingWithMike. 
From here it was very straight forward to implement.
