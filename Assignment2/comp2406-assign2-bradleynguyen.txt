1. If I removed line 24-33, I get a Sqlite Error. Since db.execute() creates a the people table, by removing it, 
the application cannot insert data into it leading to an error. I tested it by running 
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write dbdemo2.js then running a curl command to add to the database. 
After that I run into the error below:
SqliteError: no such table: people

2. Yes there is a pattern. The pattern is that all page title are 
prefixed with the value of appTitle, which is "COMP 2406 DB Demo 2." 
The pattern is centrally determined by the template_header function, 
which appends the specific page title to appTitle. In this case I changed 
const appTitle = "Bruh"; and observed that the Browser tab now says bruh when 
/list or /analyze is typed at the end or the local host url.


3. /add is treated as a form submission endpoint via POST (handled in the 
routePost function), while /add.html would be treated as a static HTML 
file. The /add route triggers the addRecord function, which adds a new 
record to the database and returns a confirmation page, while /add.html 
is likely a form page served statically.
